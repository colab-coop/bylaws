## ARTICLE II: TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP

### Section 2.1 Voluntary Withdrawal

A member at any level shall have the right to resign from the Cooperative, effective immediately without any action on the part of the Cooperative. 

For Invested Members, if voluntarily withdrawing, the Invested Member’s initial Equity Investment will be returned immediately or may be paid in installments depending on the Board’s determination concerning the Collective Account (see Article VII) and the Cooperative’s strategic planning. The Board has 30 days to come to a decision whether to return the Initial Equity Investment immediately or to make installment payments. If installment payments are chosen by the Board, the terms shall be decided at the same time. The terms shall last no longer than 1 year after the member at any level has resigned.

### Section 2.2 Death

A Membership shall immediately terminate upon the death of a member at any level. In the case of death of an Invested Member, the Member’s Initial Equity Investment will be returned to the Member’s estate upon request of the estate within one year of death.

### Section 2.3 Expulsion

(a) A Provisional or Working Member may be removed by a vote of the Board with consensus minus one for any reasonable cause.

(b) An Invested Member may be removed by a vote of the Invested Members with consensus minus one for any reasonable cause.

(c) Any Provisional, Working Member or Invested Member expulsions may be appealed with the support of two Invested Members and approved by a vote of the Invested Members with consensus minus one.

Initial capital contribution will be returned within one year in case of expulsion of the Invested Member.

### Section 2.4 Effect of Termination

(a) Membership. On the date that a Member provides written notice of intent to withdraw to the CoLab Board, on the date of a Member’s death, or upon the termination of his or her membership in CoLab in accordance with this Article II, all rights and interests of the Member in CoLab, including any voting rights, shall cease, except as provided in these Bylaws.

(b) Redemption. The terminated Member or the deceased Member's estate shall be entitled to redemption of the price paid by the Member for the Member’s Patron Member Share and the balance of the Member’s Member Account, less any obligation owed to CoLab by the Member (the “Redemption Price”). No redemption under this Article II may be made if it would render CoLab unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or causes the remaining assets of CoLab to be less than its liabilities. However, CoLab shall redeem the terminated or deceased Member’s Patron Member Share if and when the redemption of the Member’s Patron Member Share will not render CoLab unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or cause the remaining assets of CoLab to be less than its liabilities. The Redemption Price shall be paid using cash or promissory note or some combination of the two and the CoLab Board shall comply with any redemption policies created by the Board when redeeming Patron Member shares under this Article II. 

(c) If the terminated or withdrawing Member serves on the CoLab Board, termination of that person’s membership will automatically result in termination of that person’s position on the Board. Termination or withdrawal of Membership does not automatically result in the termination of the person’s employment with CoLab.
