## ARTICLE III: DECISION-MAKING

### Section 3.1 Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a) Any change to the bylaws.

(b) Any change to the Articles of Organization.

(c) Rate standardization formulas used by the cooperative, provided that the Board may decrease all pay rates by a percentage approved by the Board for all members and nonmembers in the event that the cooperative, in the Board’s sole discretion, is in a financial condition that requires reduction in pay to sustain the cooperative. The Board may also increase all pay rates by a percentage approved by the Board for all members and nonmembers in the event that the cooperative is doing well financially.

### Section 3.2 Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making matters with a goal of seeking consensus. 

For decisions brought to the Member Body, members may present decisions on Loomio (or any other tool agreed upon) for member approval. The members are expected to vote within a period of 7 days. If any member chooses not to vote, the definition of consensus will be considered as consensus among those who voted.

If they so choose, Members may elect to defer their voice in decision-making to a delegate for a specified time or specific vote, allowing the delegate to cast a "proxy" vote on their behalf. The delegate must be a member of the cooperative, and the proxy vote cast by the delegate shall be considered a vote cast by the Member for purposes of determining consensus quorum (all eligible members must vote) and final outcome. Members may exercise this option to allow decision making processes to proceed in their absence or for decisions they wish to remove themselves from for any reason. It is assumed that delegates will vote in accordance with the expressed wishes of the delegating member, to the best of their ability. 

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not necessary for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism. 

If it appears that consensus may not be reached in time for the decision to be timely or relevant any member can call a vote to determine if an alternate decision making process may be invoked. In such a vote, the Member Body will vote on the following three options: 

1. Continue with the consensus process.

2. Out the decision to a member vote which shall ratify the proposal provided there are no more than 2 members or one quarter of the total membership, whichever is greater, opposed to the proposal.

3. Defer to the decision of the Board. 

In the case that the need for a decision is imminent and after 24 hours following the calling of a membership decision process vote there is no conclusive result, the Board shall have the option of taking on the decision, though they must offer the membership an apology upon taking action, which shall include an explanation of the need for proceeding without member ratification and steps taken to ensure any demonstrated concerns of membership were taken into account. This stipulation does not apply to amendments or changes to these bylaws. Any amendments or changes to these bylaws must be approved by a consensus vote minus one of both the Invested Members and the Working Members. 

### Section 3.3 Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.2.

### Section 3.4 The Guiding Council (AKA "The Board")

As provided in the Articles of Organization, the membership shall form a board to monitor the operations of the cooperative, meet regularly to co-create strategic plans, author proposals for member ratification, and manage regular affairs deemed more impactful than the Org Areas (see below) have authority to manage, but not yet so impactful as to require entire membership consensus. The Board shall work to include all substantially impacted members in all decision-making processes.

The Board shall meet monthly and review reports from all Org Areas charged with managing the operations of the cooperative. All members shall be welcome to participate in all Board meetings (without voting participation). Non-member Collaborators may attend the Board meeting (without voting participation) if agreed upon by consensus of the Board. The Board has the authority to conduct meetings or parts of meeting that discuss information that is confidential to the Company, including but not limited to, legal, financial or other private matters, and may excuse from the meeting non-Investor Members as determined in the sole discretion of the Board.  

The minutes recorded during the Board meeting shall be made available to the general membership within 24 hours of the Board meeting. 

The Board shall make decisions following the same consensus process as used for membership decisions. All Board members present at a Board meeting shall be eligible to participate in the decision-making processes of any Board meeting. 

For decisions affecting the entire Cooperative, Board members may present decisions on Loomio (or any other tool agreed upon by the Board) for Board approval. The Board members are expected to vote within a period of 7 days. If any Board member chooses not to vote, the definition of consensus will be considered as consensus among those who voted. 

#### Qualifications for the Board

The Board shall consist of 9 persons with 6 persons nominated from the Invested Members and 3 persons nominated from the Working Members. 

(i) With respect to the Board seats for Invested Members, if possible, at least 50% of the seats shall be reserved for the diverse group, with at least 1 seat for female Invested Member and 1 seat for non-US citizen and/or non-US resident Invested Member. 

(ii) With respect to the Board seats for Working Members, if possible, at least 50% of the seats shall be reserved for the diverse group.

“Diverse” in this context means the members should consider gender, international status, religion, sexual preference, ethnicity or other categories of diversity that arise in the future. Nominations shall be made by the members who are encouraged to nominate a diverse group for the Board. 

The number of seats on the Board may change from time to time as the number of members increases or decreases.   

The Board shall be formed at least annually. All members interested in participating in the Board shall approve by consensus a set of members to be put before the Member Body for ratification as the Board. The Member Body shall then ratify the Board's proposed formation according to the membership consensus process. Should the Member Body not ratify the Board, another group shall form and propose itself as Board. 

Should the group of members interested in participating on the Board fail to come to a consensus on a proposed Board group the membership shall determine the proposed group through a Condorcet vote considering all members who put themselves forth. The group just formed shall be ratified according to the membership consensus process. 

In the event that no group is named Board, the entire Member Body shall take on the duties of the Board. 

Those on the Board shall seek to engage members not serving to serve on future Board, and shall rotate themselves out of Board membership as frequently as pragmatically feasible in a manner that provides opportunities for all coop members to participate. 

### Section 3.5 Org Areas and Working Groups

The Board shall have the option of establishing subsets of the membership called "Org Areas" and delegating decision making authority to those Org Areas in specific domains. 

Org Areas shall have Lead positions who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Org Area responsibilities as well as forming the Working Groups (see below) necessary for decisions beyond the scope of day-to-day operations. The Org Area's responsibilities and authority shall be agreed upon by consensus of the Board. The Org Area's Lead position shall be a Working or Invested Member, and shall be agreed upon by consensus of the Board. 

A document specifying the intent, responsibilities, areas of decision making, and Org Area Lead shall be created for each Org Area. 

Org Areas shall construe the field of their decision making conservatively, and work to include the larger membership in decisions that might have wider impacts through the organization. Decisions that are deemed impactful to a larger group than the Org Area shall be reported to the Board in a timely manner. Decisions that are deemed impactful to the entire membership shall be brought to the Board before being taken.

When a decision that extends beyond the day-to-day operations of the Org Area Lead is required, the Org Area Lead will announce the decision in question to the Org Area membership, visible to all Members, in order to solicit a working group to execute the decision. The working group will consist of the Org Area Lead by default, but requires the addition of at least 1 other member or collaborator. Any member or collaborator who wishes to have a say in the decision may join the Working Group. 

The Working Group will then follow the process of decision making in Section 3.2, generally attempting to find consensus.
