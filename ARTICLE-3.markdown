## ARTICLE III:  MEMBERSHIP CONSENSUS

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Acceptance of a new Member-Owner,

(b)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of Member-Owners as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions, property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the Memberships;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Memberships

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making matters with a goal of seeking consensus. If it becomes apparent that consensus cannot be reached in time for the decision to be relevant or beneficial, the Member Body or interested subset will take action as it sees fit, and will apologize to the full membership that consensus was not reached, and that it will try harder next time.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not necessary or possible for a given issue. If the decision is a binary yes/no decision, Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism. If the decision is a multiple-choice decision, the decision should be made by Condorcet Vote, followed by discussion and if necessary, re-vote in case of a tie.

### Section 3.14  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.
